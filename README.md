Rapid Enterprise Development Toolkit
```

A collection of NestJS modules
that were created for the rapid development of enterpise level APIs.

All reasonable efforts have been made to provide loosely coupled interfaces,
overridable services, and sane default implementations.

## Contributing

This project is currently in alpha testing, however, feedback is highly
appreciated and encouraged!
